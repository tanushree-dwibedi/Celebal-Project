# Celebal-Project
Grouping customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographics to target marketing strategies effectively.
 • Applied K-Means clustering algorithm on customer demographic and purchasing behavior data (Gender, Age,
 Annual Income, Spending Score) to effectively group customers into distinct behavioral segments.
 • Preprocessed dataset of over 200+ customer records by encoding categorical variables (Gender), scaling important
 numerical features, and systematically selecting the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.
 • Visualized customer clusters with 2D/3D plots using PCA and Matplotlib for clear and insightful analysis of patterns.
 Enhanced stakeholder understanding by presenting cluster characteristics through intuitive graphs and visual reports.
